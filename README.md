# Linker
----------
Linker is an attempt to create a Reddit clone, complete with subreddits (which are called Communities here), karma, image and YouTube video integration, post formatting and so on.
Linker demo is (hopefully) available [here](https://morning-wave-80681.herokuapp.com).

Linker is written on Rails 5.1.3 using Ruby version 2.4.0p0. To run linker on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` to the Linker directory
3. Run `rails s`
4. Visit [localhost:3000] in your browser
